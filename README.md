# MERN-Authentification


This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application that provides user authentication functionality with advanced security features. It implements encrypted password storage using bcrypt.js, and utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.

* Frontend Description:

The frontend of the application is built using React.js and includes additional libraries such as Redux, React Router, Axios, and MaterialUI. React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Redux is used for managing application state, React Router is used for routing, Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API, and MaterialUI is a UI component library. To install the required dependencies, the following npm commands need to be executed:

npm install react react-dom: Installs React.js and ReactDOM packages.

npm install redux react-redux: Installs Redux and React Redux packages.

npm install react-router-dom: Installs React Router package.

npm install axios: Installs Axios package.

npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled: Installs MaterialUI packages.


* Backend Description:
The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. It incorporates advanced security features such as JWT for user authentication and BcryptJS for encrypting passwords. The dotenv package is used to manage environment variables. The required backend dependencies can be installed using the following npm commands:

npm install express: Installs Express.js package.

npm install bcryptjs: Installs BcryptJS package for password encryption.

npm install dotenv: Installs dotenv package for managing environment variables.

npm install jsonwebtoken: Installs JSON Web Token package for authentication.

npm install mongoose: Installs Mongoose package for MongoDB object modeling.

npm install mongodb: Installs MongoDB package for interacting with MongoDB database.


Overall, this project provides a secure and robust user authentication system by implementing advanced security techniques such as encrypted password storage and JWT authentication.
